/**
 * Square Orders + Payments.

 * amount with the note "NOMA order — 2 item(s)". Square therefore knew a sum of
 * money and nothing else: not what was bought, not the size, not the engraving,
 * not where to ship it. A paid order that cannot be fulfilled is worse than no
 * order.
 *
 * Creating a real Order first means SQUARE holds everything needed to fulfil —
 * line items, quantities, the shipping recipient and address. That is what makes
 * the downstream report to NGF best-effort rather than load-bearing: if NGF is
 * unreachable, Nick can still ship from the Square Dashboard alone.
 *
 * Square's own condition, quoted from their docs: "An order appears in the
 * Square Dashboard or Square products if both the following conditions are true:
 * The order includes fulfillment. The order is paid." So the fulfillment block
 * is not optional decoration — without it the order is invisible to the merchant.
